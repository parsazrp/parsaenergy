# Smart Greywater Treatment System with Hybrid Renewable Energy and AI

This repository contains the code and documentation for my Bachelor's project:
**A Smart Greywater Treatment System powered by Hybrid Renewable Energy (Solar + Micro-hydro) with AI-based Water Quality Monitoring.**

---

## ðŸš€ Project Overview
- Multi-stage greywater treatment system (Pre-treatment, RO, UV disinfection).
- Integration of **Solar PV** and **Micro-hydro generator** for renewable energy supply.
- **AI-based monitoring** using a Random Forest model to predict water quality.
- IoT sensors (Arduino-based) for real-time data acquisition.
